name: nano
summary: Small, friendly text editor inspired by Pico
description: |
  GNU nano is an easy-to-use text editor originally designed as a replacement
  for Pico, the ncurses-based editor from the non-free mailer package Pine
  (itself now available under the Apache License as Alpine).

  However, GNU nano also implements many features missing in Pico, including:
    - undo/redo
    - line numbering
    - syntax coloring
    - soft-wrapping of overlong lines
    - selecting text by holding Shift
    - interactive search and replace (with regular expression support)
    - a go-to line (and column) command
    - support for multiple file buffers
    - auto-indentation
    - tab completion of filenames and search terms
    - toggling features while running
    - and full internationalization support

  This is NOT an official nano distribution, refer the issue tracker for any problems regarding the use of this snap:
